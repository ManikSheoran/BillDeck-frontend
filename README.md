## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   A running instance of the **DukaanSahaayak server**. This frontend requires the backend API to function.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/maniksheoran/DukaanSahaayak-client
    cd DukaanSahaayak-client
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**

    This project communicates with a backend API. By default, it expects the backend to be running at `http://localhost:8000`. If your backend is on a different URL, you should centralize the hardcoded URLs into a single configuration file or use environment variables.

    For a Vite project, you can create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:

    ```
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://your-backend-api-url
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## 📂 Folder Structure
